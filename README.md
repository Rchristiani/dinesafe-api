# Dinesafe api
Using the XML dataset from [HERE](http://opendata.toronto.ca/public.health/dinesafe/dinesafe.zip) the goal is to create a JSON API to allow people to interact with the data.

In addition to the data provide, geolocation data will also be added to the locations.

The API will grab the data on a regular basis and update the DB to reflect the most up to date information.
